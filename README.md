# Cancer-Detection
This is one of the mini projects from Deep Learning Nanodegree proram. Deep Learning have it's major influence over the medical research where Cancer Detection is a major boom.
For Cancer detection Pytorch is used, as it is  a deep learning research platform that provides maximum flexibility and speed.
It also have some popular libraries:
GPyTorch is a highly efficient and modular implementation with GPU acceleration. It’s implemented in PyTorch and combines Gaussian processes with deep neural networks.
BoTorch is a PyTorch-related library for Bayesian optimization.
AllenNLP is an open-source NLP research library, built on PyTorch.
PyTorch is also well-received by major cloud platforms, allowing developers and engineers to do large-scale training jobs on GPUs with PyTorch.
PyTorch’s cloud support also provides the ability to run models in a production environment. Not only that, we can also scale our PyTorch model using the cloud. We can also work with PyTorch using AWS Sagemaker (AWS CLoud).
